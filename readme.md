## The Algorithm

How this project works: This project consists a webcam and you need to pick out any lego brick you have. I recommend you use a glass plate and placing the brick very close to the camera. You have to run the cells from top to bottom except for the cell on the very bottom. Then when you place the brick close to the camera, the computer will identify the right color. Look at the prediction because it tells you what color it is. However, it may be incorrect so you have to put the brick at the right angle until it shows you the right color.

## Running this project

First you have to start by running the cells from top to bottom but don't run the last cell until the end.
Then you grab a lego brick and place it on a glass plate or hold the brick with your fingers. You have to place it very close to the camera.
Then you need to angle the brick until the computer says the right color of the brick.
Keep going with this proccess for as many times as you like.
When you are done, run the last cell that turns off the camera.

This project has jetson-inference library.
